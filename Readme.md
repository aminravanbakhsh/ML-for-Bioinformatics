## Machine Learning for BioInformatics


Extracting principal features of sickness symptoms from prior data of patients, using probabilistic models (GMM, EM) to classify patients.
### Brain tumor diagnosis
Tumor detection by CNN (VGG16 net) and visualizing essential factors of results by Grad-CAM.
### Hearbeat Classification
Comparison between LSTM and CNN methods to classify heartbeats from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, implementation the best clustering method.
### Digit Generator by GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)
Implementing Generative Adversarial Networks to generate artificial digit images which are barely distinguished with real handwritten digits.
