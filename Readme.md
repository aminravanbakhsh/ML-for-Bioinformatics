## Machine Learning for BioInformatics

### Homeworks:
#### HW_1: Prognosis of diabetes and treatment cost prediction
Diabetes detection and treatment cost prediction by patient symptoms and prior data.
#### HW_2: Diagnosis of heart disease
Comparison of probabilistic models (Naive Bayes), Logistic Regression, SVM-kernel, Ensemble learning, Neural Networks to find and implement the best classifier to detect heart diseases, using prior knowledge from patents.
#### HW_3: Covid-19 diagnosis
Extracting principal features of sickness symptoms from prior data of patients, using probabilistic models (GMM, EM) to classify patients.
#### HW_4: Brain tumor diagnosis
Tumor detection by CNN (VGG16 net) and visualizing essential factors of results by Grad-CAM.
#### HW_5: Hearbeat Classification
Comparison between LSTM and CNN methods to classify heartbeats from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, implementation the best clustering method.
#### HW_6: Digit Generator by GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks)
Implementing Generative Adversarial Networks to generate artificial digit images which are barely distinguished with real handwritten digits.
